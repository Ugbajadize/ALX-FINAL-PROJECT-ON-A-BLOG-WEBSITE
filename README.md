# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

In this project, we aim to create a dynamic and engaging blog website that caters to a specific niche or area of interest. The primary objective is to develop a user-friendly platform where you can regularly publish high-quality content, interact with readers, and build a community around your chosen topic.
